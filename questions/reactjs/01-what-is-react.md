# What is React?

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Answer

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It follows a component-based architecture where UI is broken down into reusable components.

Key features:
- **Component-based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates by comparing virtual DOM trees
- **Declarative**: Describe what the UI should look like, React handles the how
- **Unidirectional data flow**: Data flows down from parent to child components
- **JSX**: Syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript

React is used for building:
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Mobile apps (React Native)
- Complex interactive UIs
- Real-time dashboards
