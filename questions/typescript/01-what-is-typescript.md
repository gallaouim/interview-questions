# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that extends JavaScript with additional features.

## Answer

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It compiles to plain JavaScript and adds optional type annotations, interfaces, classes, and other features that help with large-scale application development.

Key benefits:
- **Type safety**: Catches errors at compile-time
- **Better IDE support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
- **Improved maintainability**: Self-documenting code
- **Modern JavaScript features**: Supports latest ECMAScript features

TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JavaScript runs.
