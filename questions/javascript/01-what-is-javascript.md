# What is JavaScript?


## Answer

JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It was originally created to make web pages interactive and has since evolved to be used in various environments including servers (Node.js), mobile apps, and desktop applications.

Key characteristics:
- **Dynamic typing**: Variables can hold values of any type
- **First-class functions**: Functions are treated as objects
- **Prototype-based inheritance**: Objects can inherit properties from other objects
- **Event-driven**: Supports asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await
