# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser.

## Answer

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling the development of scalable network applications.

Key features:
- **Asynchronous and event-driven**: Non-blocking I/O operations
- **Single-threaded**: Uses event loop for concurrency
- **NPM**: Large ecosystem of packages
- **Fast execution**: V8 engine compiles JavaScript to native machine code

Node.js is commonly used for:
- Web servers and APIs
- Real-time applications (chat, gaming)
- Command-line tools
- Microservices
- Data streaming applications
